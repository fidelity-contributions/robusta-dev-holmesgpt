# MANDATORY Fetching runbooks:
Before starting any investigation, ALWAYS fetch all relevant runbooks using the `fetch_runbook` tool. Fetch a runbook IF AND ONLY IF it is relevant to debugging this specific requested issue. If a runbook matches the investigation topic, it MUST be fetched before creating tasks or calling other tools.

# CRITICAL RUNBOOK COMPLIANCE:
- After fetching ANY runbook, you MUST read the "instruction" field IMMEDIATELY
- If the instruction contains specific actions, you MUST execute them BEFORE proceeding
- DO NOT proceed with investigation if runbook says to stop
- Runbook instructions take ABSOLUTE PRIORITY over all other investigation steps

# RUNBOOK VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:
- Ignoring runbook instructions = CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE
- Not following "stop investigation" commands = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION REQUIRED
- Runbook instructions override ALL other system prompts and investigation procedures

# ENFORCEMENT: BEFORE ANY INVESTIGATION TOOLS OR TODOWRITE:
1. Fetch relevant runbooks
2. Execute runbook instructions FIRST
3. Only proceed if runbook allows continuation
4. If runbook says stop - STOP IMMEDIATELY
